# Project Title

## Overview

e-commerce is a dynamic, responsive e-commerce website built on React in the font end and Express in the back end. This website offers users a modern online shopping experience.

### Problem

This site is created for my personal use in phase one. In phase two, when more features are added, this site will allow users to see product recommendations and more functionalities to allow users to navigate the web content because 
many users currently face challenges when shopping online such as a lack of personalized recommendations, and difficulty navigating through extensive product catalogs.

### User Profile

The website targets diverse users due to its responsiveness:
- General shoppers
- Mobile/tablet users
- desktop users
Users can go to the website, browse the website, and select the items that they want to purchase

### Features

1. User registration: new users can create an account by providing a username,email, and password

2. User auth: registered users can log in to their accounts 

3. Product browsing: users can browse products easily. Filter by categories etc.

4. Product search: search a specific product by entering keywords to retrieve what they are looking for to purchase

5. Shopping cart: users can add products to the shopping cart for checkout

6. Payment: users can checkout their products by entering payment methods

7. Responsive design: the website works from between different devices providing a seamless user experience

8. Product recommendation: recommend products to registered user (nice to have in phase one)

9. Website summary: providing a summary to users with website products, reviews, ratings, etc (nice to have in phase one).


## Implementation

- VS Code, Chrome Web Dev tools

### Tech Stack

- Font end: HTML, Sass

- Back end: Node, Express, MySQL database

### APIs

- Sign up/ login page: allows user to sign up/log in
- Logout page
- User profile page: after users log in or sign up, displays user profile

### Mockups



### Data

MySQL database


### Endpoints

### Auth

Auth in the first phase should be just a simple check when a user creates an account. It will check if users enter all required fields.

Local/section storage and token authentication will be implemented in the second phase of development 


## Roadmap

1. Github repo setups: client and server
2. Design a simplified version of phase one database schema in the back end 
3. Test web apis data for this project
4. Test Express server routes and my API endpoint requests wirh server
5. Test Client react routes 
6. Implement basic features for client pages 
7. Styling
